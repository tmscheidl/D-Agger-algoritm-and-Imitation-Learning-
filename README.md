# D-Agger-algoritm-and-Imitation-Learning-

In this exercise, we will have to train an agent using Imitation Learning Technique. We need to implement a neural network and train a behavioural cloning agent using the provided demonstration dataset. After we have to implement the DAgger algorithm to improve our agent. (Unfortunately, I did not implement the DAgger algorithm.)
Our agent must expect a single grayscale state with a resolution of 84X84.
After that we need to export the train agent as ONNX file and we need to submit it for evaluation.
